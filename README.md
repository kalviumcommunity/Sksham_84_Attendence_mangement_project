School Attendance System
This is a 10-part code-along project to build a console-based school attendance system in Java.

## Session 1: Introduction and Orientation
- Verified Java and Git setup.
- Initialized Git repository for the project.
- Created basic project structure with Main.java.
- Compiled and ran the initial "Welcome" program.
- Pushed initial setup to a part-01 branch on GitHub and created a PR.

### How to Run
1. Navigate to the project root directory (AttendanceSystem).
2. Compile: javac src/com/school/Main.java
3. Run: java -cp src com.school.Main

## Part 6: Interface-Driven Persistence with Storage
- Defined a `Storable` interface with a `toDataString()` method.
- Modified `Student`, `Course`, and `AttendanceRecord` classes to implement the `Storable` interface and provide their specific `toDataString()` implementations (CSV format).
- Created a `FileStorageService` class with a `saveData(List<? extends Storable> items, String filename)` method to write `Storable` objects to a text file.
- Utilized `try-with-resources` for safe file handling (`PrintWriter`, `FileWriter`).
- Demonstrated in `Main.java` how to save lists of students, courses, and attendance records to separate files (`students.txt`, `courses.txt`, `attendance_log.txt`).
- Discussed the flexibility provided by interfaces for handling different types of storable objects uniformly.
